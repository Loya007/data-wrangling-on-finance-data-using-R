# Importing all the libraries required


```{r SECTION A}
library(tidyverse)
library(Stat2Data)
library(scales)
```
# A1
*Importing the dataset to R.


* finding the number of rows and columns of the given dataset

```{r SECTION A1}

finance_data_original <- read.csv(file = "finance_data_EMATM0061.csv") #importing the data sets

nrow(finance_data_original)
ncol(finance_data_original)
#finding the number of rows and columns of the given dataset, the above dataset has 1051 rows and 30 columns
```

  
# A2
* Generate a new data frame called “finance_data” which is a subset of the “finance_data_original” data frame with the same number of rows, but only six columns

* selecting and renaming a few certain columns of finance data

```{r SECTION A2}
finance_data <- finance_data_original %>%
  select(state_year_code,Details.Education.Education.Total,Details.Health.Health.Total.Expenditure,Details.Transportation.Highways.Highways.Total.Expenditure,Totals.Revenue,Totals.Expenditure)  %>%
  rename(education_expenditure = Details.Education.Education.Total, health_expenditure = Details.Health.Health.Total.Expenditure, transport_expenditure = Details.Transportation.Highways.Highways.Total.Expenditure, totals_revenue = Totals.Revenue, totals_expenditure = Totals.Expenditure)

#displaying the specific renamed of finance_data
finance_data %>%
  select(state_year_code,education_expenditure,health_expenditure) %>%
  head(5)
```
# A3
* Creating a new column within the “finance_data” data frame called “totals_savings” which is equal to the difference between revenue and the expenditure i.e, the elements of the “totals_savings” column are equal to elements within the “totals_revenue” minus the element within the “totals_expenditure” column, for each row.
```{r SECTION A3}
#creating a new column named total_savings
finance_data <- finance_data %>%
  mutate(totals_savings = totals_revenue - totals_expenditure)
head(finance_data,5)


finance_data %>%
  select(state_year_code,totals_revenue,totals_expenditure,totals_savings) %>%
  head(3)

```

# A4
* Dividing the “state_year_code” column into two separate columns, a “state” column and a “year” column which replace the original “state_year_code” column.
* converting the first letter of state into uppercase and rest lowercase
```{r SECTION A4}

#seprating the state and year column
finance_data <- finance_data %>%
  separate(state_year_code,into=c("state","year"),sep = '__')


#converting the first letter of state into uppercase and rest lowercase
finance_data$state = str_to_title(finance_data$state)
head(finance_data)

finance_data %>%
  select(state,year,totals_revenue,totals_expenditure,totals_savings) %>%
  head(3)
```


# A5
* genrate a plot which displays the total revenue (“total_revenue”) as function of the year (“year”) for the following four states: Louisiana, Montana, Mississippi and Kentucky.

* creating a temporary dataframe to plot a graph for specified states
```{r SECTION A5}
#creating a temporary dataframe to plot a graph for specified states
finance_data_plot <- finance_data%>%
  select(year,totals_revenue,state)%>%
  filter(state == "Louisiana"| state =="Montana"| state =="Mississippi"|state =="Kentucky")
#finance_data_plot  #checking our data frame once
#in the above step we are filtering the states that are desired for plotting a graph



finance_data_plot$year <- as.numeric(finance_data_plot$year)
#since the column "year" is of type "char" so we convert it into numeric to plot a graph
mode(finance_data_plot$year) #checking whether the value of year changed to numeric from char

ggplot(data = finance_data_plot,aes(x=year,y=totals_revenue,color=state,linetype = state))+xlab("Year")+ylab("Revenue(millions $)")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale = 1e-6))+geom_smooth()+theme_bw()
#labeling the numbers to millions because the number are too great for the graph
```

# A6

*Creating a function called get_decade() to convert all the years to their respective decades.
*Using the get_decade() function to add a new column to the “finance_data” data frame called “decade”
*which gives the decade corresponding to the year column.
```{r SECTION A6}
#declaring function get decade to convert all the years to their respective decades
get_decade <- function(year){
  if(year%%10 == 0){
  }
  else{
    year = year-(year%%10)
  }
  return(year)
}

finance_data$year <- as.numeric(finance_data$year) #changing the value of year to numeric since it is in char and our function decade works for numeric values.
mode(finance_data$year) #checking whether the value of year changed to numeric from char

decade <- map_dbl(finance_data$year,get_decade)
#applying decade function to the "year" column of finance_data

finance_data <- finance_data %>%
  mutate(decade)

finance_data %>%head(4)


finance_data %>%
  group_by(state,decade) %>%
  filter(decade==2000) %>%
  summarise(mean_average_savings = mean(totals_savings,na.rm= TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc( mean_average_savings)) %>%
  head(3)# using head only till 3 since highest mean average of 3 states was asked and we got the highest by arranging the rows in descending order

```

# A7
* Generate a summary data frame from the “finance_data” data frame called “alaska_summary” with certain specific properties.
```{r SECTION A7}
alaska_summary <- finance_data %>%
  select(everything()) %>%
  filter(state == "Alaska" & decade >=1990 | decade <= 2010) %>%
  group_by(decade) %>%
  summarise(ed_mn = mean(education_expenditure,na.rm=TRUE), ed_md = median(education_expenditure,na.rm=TRUE), he_mn = mean(health_expenditure,na.rm=TRUE), he_md = median(health_expenditure,na.rm=TRUE), tr_mn = mean(transport_expenditure,na.rm=TRUE), tr_md = median(transport_expenditure,na.rm=TRUE))

alaska_summary
```

# A8
* Removing all the NaaN/Missing values by using the function "impute_by_median()".
* generating a subset of your “finance_data” data frame called “idaho_2000” which contains all those rows in
* which the state column takes the value “Idaho” and the “decade” column takes the value “2000” and includes
* the columns “year”, “education_expenditure”, “health_expenditure”, “transport_expenditure”, “totals_revenue”,
* “totals_expenditure”, “totals_savings” (i'.e. all columns except “state” and “decade”).
* Removing all the NaaN values using the "impure_by_median()".
* Displaying a subset of your “idaho_2000_imputed” data frame consisting of the first five rows and the four columns
* “year”, “health_expenditure”, “education_expenditure” and “totals_savings”.

```{r SECTION A8}
impute_by_median<-function(x){
m_med<-median(x,na.rm=1) # first compute the mean of x
impute_f<-function(z){ # coordinate-wise imputation
if(is.na(z)){
return(m_med) # if z is na replace with mean
}else{
return(z) # otherwise leave in place
}
}
return(map_dbl(x,impute_f)) # apply the map function to impute across vector
}

idaho_2000<-finance_data%>%
  filter(state=="Idaho"& decade==2000)%>%
  select(-state,-decade)
idaho_2000

table(is.na(idaho_2000))#finding the total number of null values on the dataframe


idaho_2000_imputed <- map_df(idaho_2000,impute_by_median)#removing the numm values


idaho_2000_imputed%>%select(year, health_expenditure, education_expenditure,totals_savings)%>%
